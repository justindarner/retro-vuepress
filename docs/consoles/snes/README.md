# Super Nintendo / Super Famicom

All original (large) versions of the Super Nintendo and Super Famicom (NTSC & PAL) can output RGB without a modification – All that’s required is [the proper cable](/consoles/snes/csync.md).  The SNES Mini / SNES Jr. outputs a better signal then most of the large versions, but requires a modification to get RGB.  Please scroll down for more information:

## [Super Nintendo / Super Famicom RGB Cables and sync information](/consoles/snes/csync.md)

This page describes in detail which RGB cables to buy and which will output proper sync.

## [SNES Version Compare](/consoles/snes/version/)

This page shows you the different versions of the SNES and compares the video quality of each of the revisions.

## [SNES Mini RGB Info](/consoles/snes/mini/rgb.md)

The SNES Mini / Jr requires a modification to enable RGB output.  This page provides information on the different SNES Mini RGB mods available.

## [SNES 1CHIP Revision](/consoles/snes/1chip/README.md)

The SNES “1CHIP” consoles are the only revisions in the original case that output video quality as good as the SNES Mini.  This page has information on these consoles, methods to find them and ways to enhance them.

## [SNES Digital Audio Mod](/consoles/snes/digital-audio/README.md)

The SNES is capable of outputting SPDIF digital audio.

## [SNES Vertical Line](/consoles/snes/vertical-line)

This page describes the SNES “vertical line” issue and ways to fix it.

## [SNES Tips](/consoles/snes/tips.md)

This page shows tips for SNES systems, such as fixing a loose cartridge release lever and a quick mod to play NTSC-J games on NTSC systems.

## [Super NT](http://retrorgb.com/supernt.html)

The Super NT is an FPGA SNES designed by Kevtris that outputs up to 1080p 5x in HDMI.  It’s absolutely amazing and in my opinion, a “must have” for any SNES fan who games on a flat-screen.

## Summary

– If you don’t “need” a model 1, just get a SNES Mini and either [mod it for RGB](/consoles/snes/mini/rgb.md), or send it out to be modded.

– If you insist on using an original SNES 1, try to hunt down a console with a serial number that starts with “UN3” (as explained in the [1CHIP SNES section](/consoles/snes/1chip/finding-the-1chip)), then open it up and hope it’s a 1CHIP!

– If you insist on using a model 1 SNES and want the best possible quality, check out the 1CHIP mods available.

– If you’re a fan of Super Metroid, I have a page dedicated to .

If you’d like info on mods for other systems, head to the [Getting RGB From Each System page](consoles/README.md) or check out [the main page](/README.md) for more retro-awesomeness.
