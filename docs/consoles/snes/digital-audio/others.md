**SNES Digital Audio Mod – Other Console Revisions**

This page shows install points for original Super Nintendo / Super Famicom systems that aren’t the 1CHIP or Mini / Jr. Models.

Each SNES / Super Famicom system uses one of two audio chips listed on [the main SNES Digital Audio Page](/consoles/snes/digital-audio/README.md).  The pinouts on the chips are always the same, but the via’s are different on each motherboard revision.  I wanted to create a page to show the installations I’ve done, as well as their most convenient install points.  I’ll update this page each time I install the board in a different revision system.

For installation in your system, you’ll need to follow the [SNES 1CHIP Digital Audio](/consoles/snes/digital-audio/README.md) instructions exactly; The only difference will be the solder points for the audio chip.

**Super Famicom SNS-CPU-APU-01**
On the model I tested, not all pins on the chip were available as via’s. Please click for a full-sized view:

That’s all I have for now, but I’ll add more as I come across them.  Feel free to [email me](/contact) pics if you’d like to contribute to this page.

If you’re done, feel free to go back to the [main SNES page](/consoles/snes/README.md).  If you’d like info on mods for other systems, head to the [Getting RGB From Each System page](consoles/README.md)or check out [the main page](/README.md) for more retro-awesomeness.
