This page shows some random tips for SNES systems. Rather then create a page for each, I thought it would be easier to put them all on one page. [Let me know](/contact) if you have any other great tips I haven’t listed yet:
 

## Loose Cartridge Lever on SNES 1

If your cartridge release lever isn’t as firm as it used to be, you can simply move the spring slightly over. I find moving it just this tiny bit makes a huge difference:

## NTSC-J cartridges on NTSC Systems

You can play Japanese Super Famicom cartridges on a North American SNES (or SNES Mini), simply by cutting two tabs inside the cartridge slot. This will *not* allow you to play PAL games on an NTSC SNES, but it will let you play all NTSC-J games, as well as use the Super Game Boy 2:

Alternatively, if you’d rather not cut any plastic on your console, you can just swap out the underside of the plastic with a 3D-printed tray!:  [https://www.shapeways.com/product/MARFTPFQQ/unisn2-tray-for-snes-2?optionId=56237730](https://www.shapeways.com/product/MARFTPFQQ/unisn2-tray-for-snes-2?optionId=56237730)



## SNES Component Video Out

Some older SNES’ can be modded to output component video. I prefer using the 1CHIP or Mini versions in RGB, but here’s a link if you’re interested:

As an FYI, if you’re just looking for component video output, using teh HDRetrovision cables are an easier choice:  [http://www.hdretrovision.com/snes/](http://www.hdretrovision.com/snes/)

That’s it for now. I’ll try to add more.

Feel free to go back to the [main SNES page](/consoles/snes/README.md).  If you’d like info on mods for other systems, head to the [Getting RGB From Each System page](consoles/README.md)or check out [the main page](/README.md) for more retro-awesomeness.
